# Infra for VM's

Here's a breakdown of the `gcloud compute instances create` command for creating a virtual machine instances for the Kubernetes cluster.

**Project and Zone:**
* `--project=$PROJECT_NAME`: This specifies the Google Cloud project where the instance will be created.
* `--zone=asia-south1-c`: This defines the zone within the project where the instance will reside.

**Machine Configuration:**
* `--machine-type=e2-*`: This sets the machine type, which determines the CPU, memory, and storage resources for the instance. Here, it's a medium-sized e2 machine.

**Network Configuration:**
* `--network-interface=network-tier=STANDARD,stack-type=IPV4_ONLY,subnet=$VPC_NAME`: This configures the network interface for the instance. It uses a standard network tier, IPv4 addresses only, and connects it to the subnet created in the VPC.

**Startup Script and Maintenance:**
* `--metadata-from-file=startup-script=/terraform/scripts/*.sh`: This specifies a startup script located at `/terraform/scripts/*.sh` that will be executed when the instance starts.
* `--maintenance-policy=MIGRATE`: This sets the maintenance policy to migrate the instance to a different host during scheduled maintenance.
* `--provisioning-model=STANDARD`: This uses the standard provisioning model for creating the instance.

**Service Account and Permissions:**
* `--service-account=$SERVICE_ACCOUNT@$PROJECT_NAME.iam.gserviceaccount.com`: This assigns a service account with the provided email address to the instance.
* `--scopes=https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform`: This grants the service account broad cloud platform permissions.

**Security and Tags:**
* `--tags=http-server,https-server,lb-health-check`: This adds tags to the instance for identification and firewall rules.
* `--no-shielded-secure-boot`: This disables secure boot for the instance. (Not recommended for production)
* `--shielded-vtpm`: This enables Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for hardware-based security.
* `--shielded-integrity-monitoring`: This enables monitoring of the instance's file system integrity.

**Disk Configuration:**
* `--create-disk`: This creates a new persistent disk for the instance with these properties:
    * `auto-delete=yes`: The disk is automatically deleted when the instance is terminated.
    * `boot=yes`: This disk is used as the boot disk for the instance.
    * `device-name=k8-cluster-nodes`: This sets a name for the disk.
    * `image=projects/ubuntu-os-cloud/global/images/ubuntu-2004-focal-v20240307b`: This specifies a pre-configured Ubuntu 20.04 image for the disk.
    * `mode=rw`: The disk is mounted with read-write access.
    * `size=*`: The disk size is set to the specified size in GB.
    * `type=projects/$PROJECT_NAME/zones/asia-south1-c/diskTypes/pd-balanced`: This uses a persistent disk of type "pd-balanced" within the project and zone.

**Labels:**
* `--labels=node=slave01,goog-ec-src=vm_add-gcloud`: This assigns labels to the instance for further organization and identification.

**Reservation Affinity:**
* `--reservation-affinity=any`: This allows the instance to be placed on any available resources without a specific reservation requirement.
